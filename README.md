# Fraud Detection

This project involved working with imbalanced data and developing fraud detection models with both labeled and unlabeled data.

In the first part of the project, highly imbalanced fraud data was handled by resampling the data using different resampling methods. The focus was on understanding the challenges of imbalanced data and the techniques to deal with them.

In the second part, supervised learning techniques were used to detect fraud in labeled data. Reliable performance metrics were obtained and the precision recall trade-off was explored. The model parameters were optimized to handle the fraud data, and ensemble methods were applied for better performance.

In the third part, the focus was on detecting fraud without labels. The importance of segmentation was learned, and clustering methods such as K-means clustering and DB-scan clustering were used to detect fraud using outliers and small clusters.

Overall, this project provided hands-on experience with different techniques to handle imbalanced data and develop fraud detection models.
